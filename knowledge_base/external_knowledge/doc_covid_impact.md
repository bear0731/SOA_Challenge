# COVID-19 Impact on Mortality (2020-2021)
    
## Overview
During the years 2020 and 2021, general population mortality increased significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

## Key Observations for Insured Populations
*   **Older Age Groups (65+)**: Experienced the highest excess mortality. Relative risk increased by ~25% in peak months.
*   **Direct vs Indirect**: While direct COVID deaths were high, indirect excess mortality (delayed medical care) was also observed.
*   **Model Implications**: Historical models trained on pre-2020 data tends to UNDERESTIMATE mortality in these calendar years. A/E ratios > 1.0 are expected.
