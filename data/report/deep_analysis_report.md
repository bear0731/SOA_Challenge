## Key Insights

1. Average A/E Ratio by Amount across attained ages: 0.946
2. A/E Ratio by Count is generally higher than by Amount, indicating smaller policies have higher mortality.
3. Smoker segments consistently show higher A/E ratios than nonsmoker segments.
4. Younger issue ages (18-29, 30-39) tend to have higher A/E ratios, possibly due to anti-selection.
5. Early durations (1-3) often show higher A/E variability, indicating selection effects.
6. Female segments generally show lower A/E ratios compared to male segments.
7. Older ages (65+) generally show A/E ratios closer to or above 1.0, indicating mortality aligns with expectations.
